As a part of the Flexible Ai and Mechatroncis Lab (FAMS) I worked on designing new types of soft actuators for soft robotic prothestics and orthotics powered by an pneumatic system. 
My primary designs are a multi-chamber wrist which can bend in multiple directions, and a new finger model to be utilized in the system.
