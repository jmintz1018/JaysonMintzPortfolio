This project was a part of my Robtots for Disability course at NYU. There were 2 parts to this project, a simulation project, and a physical project.
Our work is based on the paper published by M. Fischer et al, "Tremor Compensation by Use of a Mechatronic Cup Holder."
For the simulation portion, the kinematics of the overall system, both the compensator and the sloshing of liquid was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.
A randomly generated signal was utilized to simulate tremors induced by a person with Parkinson's and calculations were performed to obtain the needed actuator angles which was then visualized.
For the physcial portion of the project, the system was updated to utilize a single orientation sensor, and all of the 3D printed components, included the kinematic chains were remodeled.
As the perviously mentioned paper did not give measurements for any components, additional simulations were performed to identify the ideal kinematic chain length to achieve the best range of motion for the system.
